 # Data Analysis Mini Project

This project is a small, self-contained data analysis exercise designed to
practise Python, pandas and basic visualisation skills.  
The dataset represents daily website visitors and conversions for a fictional
company across one week.

The goal was to demonstrate a clear, simple analysis workflow that includes:
- Loading data from a CSV file  
- Exploring and summarising key metrics  
- Performing small calculations (e.g., conversion rates)  
- Producing a clean visualisation to highlight patterns in the data
