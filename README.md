# Data Analysis Mini Project

This small project demonstrates introductory data analysis skills in Python.

The script shows how to:

- Load a simple CSV dataset using `pandas`
- Explore the data with summary statistics
- Perform basic grouping and aggregation
- Create a simple visualisation using `matplotlib`

The dataset is a small, made-up example representing website visitors and
conversions over several days.
## How to run

1. Install Python 3 and `pip`.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
