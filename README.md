# Data Analysis Mini Project

This small project is a self-contained data analysis exercise designed to practise Python, pandas and basic data visualisation skills.  
The dataset represents daily website visitors and conversions for a fictional company across one week.

The goal was to demonstrate a clear, simple analysis workflow that includes:

- Loading data from a CSV file  
- Exploring and summarising key metrics  
- Performing small calculations (e.g. conversion rates)  
- Producing a clean visualisation to highlight patterns in the data  

---

## Project Structure

- `data.csv` – input dataset containing dates and visitor counts  
- `analysis.py` – Python script that loads the data, prints summary statistics and creates a line chart  
- `visitors_over_time.png` – output image generated by the script (daily visitors line chart)

## How to Run the Script

If you want to recreate the analysis locally:

1. Install Python 3  
2. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
python analysis.py
